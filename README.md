# Gitr
## A Project Management And Collaboration Tool For Github

## Synopsis
Project management through Gtihub can be challenging. All the contributors for a project work at different times and solve problems in very different ways. This poses conflicts! Not just physical conflicts but merge conflicts, wasted work, and differing objectives. Through Gitr, you will be able to keep the live pulse of each projects to ensure your contributions are effective, efficient, and known in a beautiful all in one solution.

## Quick Feature Overview
Gitr relies heavily on the Github API. Through a custom adapter pattern, users are able to make all kinds of requests through our intuitive UI.
This allows easy functionality to many of Github's non-standard features like milestones and webhook notifications.

## Motivation
This project was created to ease the pain associated with project management and collaboration operations.

## API Reference
We explicitly use the Github API. Documentation can be found here: https://developer.github.com/v3/

## Tests
The testing package utilized is through RSPEC. After forking the project, you are able to just run the 'rspec' command from your terminal.
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
